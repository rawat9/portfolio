    the feeling of finally figuring out a solution to a problem. My core stack is{' '}
    <span class="font-medium"> React, Next.js, Node.js, and MongoDB </span>

    am currently looking for a{' '}
    <span class="font-medium">full-time position</span> as a software developer.

    and playing with my dog. I also enjoy{' '}
    <span class="font-medium">learning new things</span>. I am currently learning about{' '}
